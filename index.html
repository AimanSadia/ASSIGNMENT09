        <h1 class="heading">Benefits of Reading Books: How It Can Positively Affect Your Life</h1>

        <h3 class="first">Reading strengthens your brain</h3>
        <p id="first">A growing body of research indicates that reading literally changes your mind.

            Using MRI scans, researchers have confirmedTrusted Source that reading involves a complex network of
            circuits
            and signals in the brain. As your reading ability matures, those networks also get stronger and more
            sophisticated.

            In one studyTrusted Source conducted in 2013, researchers used functional MRI scans to measure the effect of
            reading a novel on the brain. Study participants read the novel “Pompeii” over a period of 9 days. As
            tension
            built in the story, more and more areas of the brain lit up with activity.

            Brain scans showed that throughout the reading period and for days afterward, brain connectivity increased,
            especially in the somatosensory cortex, the part of the brain that responds to physical sensations like
            movement
            and pain.</p>

        <hr>

        <h3 class="second">Increases your ability to empathize</h3>
        <p id="second">And speaking of sensing pain, researchTrusted Source has shown that people who read literary
            fiction
            — stories that explore the inner lives of characters — show a heightened ability to understand the feelings
            and
            beliefs of others.

            Researchers call this ability the “theory of mind,” a set of skills essential for building, navigating, and
            maintaining social relationships.

            While a single session of reading literary fiction isn’t likely to spark this feeling, researchTrusted
            Source
            shows that long-term fiction readers do tend to have a better-developed theory of mind.</p>

        <hr>

        <h3 class="third">Builds your vocabulary</h3>
        <p id="third">Reading researchers as far back as the 1960s have discussed what’s known as “the Matthew
            effectTrusted
            Source,” a term that refers to biblical verse Matthew 13:12: “Whoever has will be given more, and they will
            have
            an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them.”

            The Matthew effect sums up the idea that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer — a concept that
            applies as
            much to vocabulary as it does to money.</p>

        <hr>

        <h3 class="fourth">Helps prevent age-related cognitive decline</h3>
        <p id="fourth">The National Institute on AgingTrusted Source recommends reading books and magazines as a way of
            keeping your mind engaged as you grow older.

            Although research hasn’t proven conclusively that reading books prevents diseases like Alzheimer’s,
            studiesTrusted Source show that seniors who read and solve math problems every day maintain and improve
            their
            cognitive functioning.

            And the earlier you start, the better. A 2013 study conducted by Rush University Medical Center found that
            people who’ve engaged in mentally stimulating activities all their lives were less likely to develop the
            plaques, lesions, and tau-protein tangles found in the brains of people with dementia.</p>

        <hr>

        <h3 class="fifth">Reduces stress</h3>
        <p id="fifth">In 2009, a group of researchers measured the effects of yoga, humor, and reading on the stress
            levels
            of students in demanding health science programs in the United States.

            The study found that 30 minutes of reading lowered blood pressure, heart rate, and feelings of psychological
            distress just as effectively as yoga and humor did.

            The authors concluded, “Since time constraints are one of the most frequently cited reasons for high stress
            levels reported by health science students, 30 minutes of one of these techniques can be easily incorporated
            into their schedule without diverting a large amount of time from their studies.”</p>

        <h3 class="sixth">Prepares you for a good night’s rest</h3>
        <p id="sixth">Doctors at the Mayo Clinic suggest reading as part of a regular sleep routine.

            For best results, you may want to choose a print book rather than reading on a screen, since the light
            emitted
            by your device could keep you awake and lead to other unwanted health outcomes.

            Doctors also recommend that you read somewhere other than your bedroom if you have trouble falling asleep.
        </p>
        <hr>

        <h3 class="seventh">Helps alleviate depression symptoms</h3>
        <p id="seventh">British philosopher Sir Roger Scruton once wrote, “Consolation from imaginary things is not an
            imaginary consolation.” People with depression often feel isolated and estranged from everyone else. And
            that’s
            a feeling books can sometimes lessen.

            Reading fiction can allow you to temporarily escape your own world and become swept up in the imagined
            experiences of the characters. And nonfiction self-help books can teach you strategies that may help you
            manage
            symptoms.

            That’s why the United Kingdom’s National Health Service has begun Reading Well, a Books on Prescription
            program,
            where medical experts prescribe self-help books curated by medical experts specifically for certain
            conditions.
        </p>
        <hr>

        <h3 class="eight">May even help you live longer</h3>
        <p class="eight">A long-term health and retirement studyTrusted Source followed a cohort of 3,635 adult
            participants
            for a period of 12 years, finding that those who read books survived around 2 years longer than those who
            either
            didn’t read or who read magazines and other forms of media.

            The study also concluded that people who read more than 3 1/2 hours every week were 23 percent likely to
            live
            longer than those who didn’t read at all.</p>

        <hr>


        <h3 class="nine">What should you be reading?</h3>
        <p id="nine">So, what should you be reading? The short answer is: Whatever you can get your hands on.

            There was a time when remote regions had to rely on librarians traversing the mountains with books stuffed
            in
            saddlebags. But that’s hardly the case today. Just about everyone can access vast libraries contained in
            cellphones and tablets.</p>

        <hr>


        <h3 class="ten">Bypass the binge-watching from time to time</h3>
        <p id="ten">There’s nothing wrong with watching an entire television series, start to finish, in a single
            weekend —
            just as there’s nothing wrong with eating a large, luscious dessert.

            But binge-watching TV probably needs to be an occasional treat rather than your main source of intellectual
            stimulation. Research shows that prolonged TV viewing, especially for children, may change the brain in
            unhealthy ways.</p>
